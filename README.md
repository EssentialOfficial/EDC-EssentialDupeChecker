# EDC-EssentialDupeChecker


**EssentialModsâ„¢ Hypixel Skyblock Dupe Checker**

__Essential Dupe Checker checker is a 1.8.9 Minecraft Forge Mod for Hypixel Skyblock which adds a Dupe Checker to Skyblock.__

**What does it do?**

This mod adds an Intelligent Dupe checker into your skyblock experience, which allows you to track the UUID of items and compare them to the Hypixel Servers to make sure the items you buy are 100% safe and not duped!

**Why is this useful?**

Many players have been wiped before, now this will prevent it. Don't buy anything before Dupe Checking it! Our goal is to keep your Skyblock profile safe from scammers and bugged items.

**Is this bannable?** 

Short answer: This mod follows the general interpretation of Hypixel's rules and does not modify packets in any way. As of now, it is not bannable, but as with all mods, it is use at your own risk.

(Disclaimer) The mod doesn't work outside of inventories, it is not applicable on auction house, and it is a lot more accurate than mods like Skytils and Skyblock Extras due to our special ArrayList Scanning Technology.
